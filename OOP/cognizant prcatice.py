# PYTHON HAS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES
"""
1. Simple to learn 
2. Open-Source 
3.Versatile :IE USED for various application like ml data ,sci ,web dev 
4.dynamically typed - type of varaible its value are all checked at runtime 
5.Object -Oriented Programming language .
6. emdbedded - python code can run along with any programming language,
7.IT IS CASE SENSITIVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
"""

# Python files are saved with .py extensions

#Comments in python -lines which are not executed
#- denotes single line commment
""" multiline commmnets"""

#PYHTON CONSOLE CAN BE ACCESSED IN TWO WAYS 
"""
1.DIRECTTLLY RUNNING THE INTERPRETER BY COMMMAND LINE BY THE COMMAND
    -- python <name of file>.py

2. Using the GUI of of pyhton IDLE -Integrated learning and developement environment
    -- wroks on different platform like Windows , Linux ,Mac

# VARIABLE MEMERORY PARTS OF THE COMPUTER WHERE VALUES CAN BE STORED AND THESE VALUES CAN VARY .
#the values can be of dfferent types known as data types . STANDARD DATA TYPES - numbers,string ,list,tuple,dictionary
#VARIABLES ARE KNOWN BY THEIR NAMES MAKING VARIBALES IDENTIFIERS.

# rules for deciding the names -

1. first chracter of name can be _ of character values
2. name can contain digits(0-9), characters a-z A-z and _
3.Nospecial characters allowed.
